# Low-Discrepancy Sequences

In this section, the following kinds of *low-discrepancy sequences* will 
be described:

- [Sukharev Grid](#sukharev-grid)
- [Sobol' Sequence](#sobol-sequence)
- [Halton Sequence](#halton-sequence)
- [Rank-1 Lattice Design](#rank1-lattice)
- [Korobov Sequence](#korobov-sequence)
- [Cranley-Patterson Randomization](#cranley-patterson)

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    All available designs can be accessed after a simple import statement:
    
    ```python
    >>> from pyDOE3 import *
    ```
