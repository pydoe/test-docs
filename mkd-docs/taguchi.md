# Taguchi Designs

In this section, the following kinds of *Taguchi designs* will 
be described:

- [Orthogonal Arrays](#orthogonal-arrays)
- [Robust Design Utilities](#robust-design-utilities)

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    All available designs can be accessed after a simple import statement:
    
    ```python
    >>> from pyDOE3 import *
    ```

## Orthogonal Arrays {#orthogonal-arrays}

Taguchi orthogonal arrays for robust design experiments.
